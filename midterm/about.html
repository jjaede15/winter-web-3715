    <p style="font-size: larger;">Hey, my name is Juni, and I decided to make this website because I'm very interested in the ocean and marine mammals in general. I don’t know much about sea otters, so I wanted to make this website to learn more about them, and, of course, they are very, very cute! My hope for this site was to provide people like me with the basics about sea otters.

The sea otters have always really interested me, but I've never taken the time to learn about them. While doing this, I realized how important sea otters are to the marine ecosystem. They help keep the ecosystem balanced. Which made me like them even more

My goal for this website is to make learning about sea otters simple and easy to understand. You don’t need to know a lot about science or marine biology to enjoy this site. It’s meant for people like me who are just curious and want to learn the basics without it feeling confusing or boring.

I hope this website helps people learn something new about sea otters and maybe even get more interested in the ocean in general. The ocean and the animals that live in it are really important, and the more we learn about them, the better we can understand why they deserve protection. Plus, sea otters are seriously adorable, so I hope you enjoy learning about them as much as I did while making this website.

-Thanks, Juni
